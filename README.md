This project is to propose and design an architecture solution using big data tools and technologies to enhance the fraud detection mechanisms for a global bank.  
This project is needed in order to combat the increasing number of fraudulent activities ranging from unauthorized credit card transactions to suspicious account activities that hint at money laundering.  
The proposed big data architecture intends to achieve the following:  
1.	Real-time detection of potentially fraudulent transactions, alerting the user and bank authorities instantly.
   
2.	Analysis of user behavior to identify unusual patterns or anomalies.
   
3.	Automatic blocking of transactions based on certain high-risk factors.
   
4.	Offering security notifications to users based on their transaction behavior and locations.
   
5.	Ensure compliance with global banking regulations regarding money laundering and fraud detection.

Big data tools and technology included in the proposal:  
1. Kafka
2. NiFi
3. HDFS
4. HBase
5. Spark
6. Hive
7. YARN
8. Solr
